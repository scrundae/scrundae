- 👋 Hi, I’m @scrundae
- 👀 I’m interested in coding. What did you expect?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Windows Forms with C# and Visual Basic
- 😄 My current focuses are:
- 1. My WinForms game "digMoundGame"
- 2. My Unity Game (no info yet!)
- ❓ No, digMoundGame is not abandoned. I'm working very hard on 0.2 okay?
